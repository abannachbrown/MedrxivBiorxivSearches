"1",106115,"Short-term exposure to intermittent hypoxia in mice leads to changes in gene expression seen in chronic pulmonary disease","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) results from intermittent episodes of airway collapse and hypoxia and is associated with a host of health complications including dementia, diabetes, heart failure, and stroke. Cellular mechanisms causing disease progression across multiple systems in OSA are unknown. Although it is known that pulmonary diseases share general mechanisms, such as systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, there is an incomplete understanding of the early-stage changes to the lung from OSA. Using intermittent hypoxia (IH) as a mouse model of OSA, we showed profound cell-type specific changes in genome-wide expression in the lung. With single-cell RNA analysis, we identified substantial similarities between lungs of mice exposed to IH and human lung tissue from patients with pulmonary disease--most notably pulmonary hypertension, COPD, and asthma. Many IH-responsive genes encode targets of drugs currently available to treat pulmonary disease. Present data provide insights into the initiation of specific cellular responses which drive disease progression in a model of OSA. This information can help direct therapies to the most relevant cells and molecular pathways.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe demonstrated profound early cell-type specific changes in genome wide expression in the lung from mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia (IH), a model for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Using single-cell RNA analysis, we also identified substantial similarities between the lungs from these mice and human lung tissue from patients with unrelated pulmonary disease. As the first single cell analysis of lung from a murine model of OSA, our data provide insight into the early cellular responses that drive disease progression. By identifying the roles of individual cells in disease, we have the opportunity to test targeted therapeutics, focusing specifically on the most relevant cells and upstream molecular pathways.","Wu, G.; Lee, Y.

"2",114198,"Disrupted Endothelial Cell Heterogeneity and Network Organization Impairs Vascular Function in Prediabetic Obesity","RationaleObesity is a major risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, and stroke. Impaired endothelial function occurs in the earliest stages of obesity and underlies vascular alterations giving rise to cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanisms that link weight gain to endothelial dysfunction are ill-defined. Increasing evidence suggests that, rather than being a population of uniformly responding cells, neighboring endothelial cells are highly heterogeneous and are organized as a communicating multicellular network that controls vascular function.

ObjectiveTo investigate the hypothesis that disrupted endothelial heterogeneity and network-level organization contributes to impaired vascular reactivity in obesity.

Methods and ResultsTo study obesity-related vascular function without the complications associated with diabetes, we induced a state of prediabetic obesity in rats. Small artery diameter recordings confirmed nitric-oxide mediated vasodilator responses were dependent on increases in endothelial calcium levels and were impaired in obese animals. Single-photon imaging revealed a linear relationship between blood vessel relaxation and network-level calcium responses. Obesity did not alter the slope of this relationship, but impaired network-level endothelial calcium responses. The network itself was comprised of structural and functional components. The structural component, a hexagonal lattice network of endothelial cells, was unchanged in obesity. The functional network contained sub-populations of clustered agonist-sensing cells from which signals were communicate through the network. In obesity there were fewer but larger clusters of agonist-sensing cells and communication path lengths between clusters was increased. Communication between neighboring cells was unaltered in obesity. Altered network organization resulted in impaired, population-level calcium signaling and deficient endothelial control of vascular tone.

Specialized subpopulations of endothelial cells had increased agonist sensitivity. These agonist-responsive cells were spatially clustered in a non-random manner and drove network level calcium responses. Communication between adjacent cells was unaltered in obesity, but there was a decrease in the size of the agonist-sensitive cell population and an increase in the clustering of agonist-responsive cells

ConclusionsThe distribution of cells in the endothelial network is critical in determining overall vascular function. Altered cell heterogeneity and arrangement in obesity decrease endothelial function and provide a novel framework for understanding compromised endothelial function in cardiovascular disease.","Wilson, C.; Zhang, X.; Lee, M.

"3",75759,"Endothelial CXCL5 negatively regulates myelination and repair after white matter stroke","Cerebral small vessel disease and resulting white matter pathologies are worsened by cardiovascular risk factors including obesity. The molecular changes in cerebral endothelial cells caused by chronic cerebrovascular risk factors remain unknown. We developed a novel approach for molecular profiling of chronically injured cerebral endothelial cells using cell-specific translating ribosome affinity purification (RiboTag) with RNA-seq in Tie2-Cre:RiboTag mice. We used this approach to identify the transcriptome of white matter endothelial cells after the onset of diet-induced obesity (DIO). DIO induces an IL-17B signaling pathway that acts on the cerebral endothelia through IL-17Rb to increase levels of both circulating CXCL5 and local endothelial expression of CXCL5 in both the DIO mouse model and in humans with imaging or pathologic evidence of cerebral small vessel disease. In the white matter, endothelial CXCL5 acts as a chemoattractant and promotes the association of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) with cerebral endothelia increasing vessel-associated OPC cell number and triggers OPC gene expression programs regulating migration and chemokine receptor activation. Targeted blockade of IL-17B with peripheral antibody administration reduced the population of vessel-associated OPCs by reducing endothelial CXCL5 expression. CXCL5-mediated sequestration of OPCs to white matter vasculature impairs OPC differentiation after a focal white matter ischemic lesion. DIO promotes a unique white matter endothelial-to-oligodendrocyte progenitor cell signaling pathway that compromises brain repair after stroke.","Xiao, G.; Kumar, R.; Komuro, Y.; Burguet, J.; Kakarla, V.; Azizkhanian, I.; Sheth, S.

"4",78708,"Evaluating the Potential of Younger Cases and Older Controls Cohorts to Improve Discovery Power in Genome-wide Association Studies of Late-onset Diseases","For more than a decade, genome-wide association studies have been making steady progress in discovering the causal gene variants that contribute to late-onset human diseases. Polygenic late-onset diseases in an aging population display the risk allele frequency decrease at older ages, caused by individuals with higher polygenic risk scores becoming ill proportionately earlier and bringing about a change in the distribution of risk alleles between new cases and the as-yet-unaffected population. This phenomenon is most prominent for diseases characterized by high cumulative incidence and high heritability, examples of which include Alzheimers disease, coronary artery disease, cerebral stroke, and type 2 diabetes, while for late-onset diseases with relatively lower prevalence and heritability, exemplified by cancers, the effect is significantly lower. Computer simulations have determined that genome-wide association studies of the late-onset polygenic diseases showing high cumulative incidence together with high initial heritability will benefit from using the youngest possible age-matched cohorts. Moreover, rather than using age-matched cohorts, study cohorts combining the youngest possible cases with the oldest possible controls may significantly improve the discovery power of genome-wide association studies.","Oliynyk, R.

"5",81968,"Brown adipose expansion and remission of glycemic dysfunction in obese SM/J mice","Disruption of glucose homeostasis increases the risk of type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer. We leverage a novel rodent model, the SM/J mouse, to understand glycemic control in obesity. On a high fat diet, obese SM/J mice initially develop impaired glucose tolerance and elevated fasting glucose. Strikingly, their glycemic dysfunction resolves by 30 weeks of age despite persistence of obesity. A prominent phenotype is that they dramatically expand their brown adipose depots as they resolve glycemic dysfunction. This occurs naturally and spontaneously on a high fat diet, with no temperature or genetic manipulation. When the brown adipose depot is removed from normoglycemic obese mice, fasting blood glucose and glucose tolerance revert to unhealthy levels, and animals become insulin resistant. We identified 267 genes whose expression changes in the brown adipose when the mice resolve their unhealthy glycemic parameters, and find the expanded tissue has a  healthier expression profile of cytokines and extracellular matrix genes. We describe morphological, physiological, and transcriptomic changes that occur during the unique brown adipose expansion and remission of glycemic dysfunction in obese SM/J mice. Understanding this phenomenon in mice will open the door for innovative therapies aimed at improving glycemic control in obesity.

Significance StatementSome obese individuals maintain normal glycemic control. Despite being obese, these individuals have low risk for metabolic complications, including type-II diabetes. If we better understood why some obese people maintain normoglycemia then we might develop new approaches for treating metabolic complications associated with obesity. However, the causative factors underlying glycemic control in obesity remain unknown. We discovered that, despite persistence of the obese state, SM/J mice enter into diabetic remission: returning to normoglycemia and reestablishing glucose tolerance and improving insulin sensitivity. A prominent phenotype is that they dramatically expand their brown adipose depots as they resolve glycemic dysfunction. Understanding this phenomenon in mice will open the door for innovative therapies aimed at improving glycemic control in obesity.","Carson, C.; Macias-Velasco, J. F.; Gunawardana, S.; Miranda, M.

"6",82334,"Statins Stimulate Hepatic Glucose Production via the miR-183/96/182 Cluster","Statins are the most common pharmacologic intervention in hypercholesterolemic patients, and their use is recognized as a key medical advance leading to a 50% decrease in deaths from heart attack or stroke over the past 30 years. The atheroprotective outcomes of statins are largely attributable to the accelerated hepatic clearance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol from circulation, following the induction of the LDL receptor. However, multiple studies suggest that these drugs exert additional LDL-independent effects. The molecular mechanisms behind these so-called pleiotropic effects of statins, either beneficial or undesired, remain largely unknown. Here we determined the coding transcriptome, miRNome, and RISCome of livers from mice dosed with saline or atorvastatin to define a novel in vivo epitranscriptional regulatory pathway that links statins to hepatic gluconeogenesis, via the SREBP2-miR-183/96/182-TCF7L2 axis. Notably, multiple genome-wide association studies identified TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7 like 2) as a candidate gene for type 2 diabetes, independent of ethnicity. Conclusion: our data reveal an unexpected link between cholesterol and glucose metabolism, provides a mechanistic explanation to the elevated risk of diabetes recently observed in patients taking statins, and identifies the miR-183/96/182 cluster as an attractive pharmacological candidate to modulate non-canonical effects of statins.","Marquart, T.

"7",84594,"Multilevel modelling, prevalence and predictors of hypertension in Ghana: Evidence from Wave 2 of the World Health Organizations Study on Global AGEing and adult health.","BackgroundHypertension is a major public health issue, a critical risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and stroke, especially in developing countries where the rates remain unacceptably high. In Africa, hypertension is the leading driver of cardiovascular disease and stroke deaths. Identification of critical risk factors of hypertension can help formulate targeted public health programmes and policies aimed at reducing the prevalence and its associated morbidity, disability and mortality. This study attempts to develop multilevel regression, an in-depth statistical model to identify critical risk factors of hypertension.\n\nMethodsThis study used data on 4381 individuals aged [&ge;]18 years from the nationally representative World Health Organization Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Ghana Wave 2. Multilevel regression modelling was employed to identify critical risk factors for hypertension based on systolic blood pressure (SBP) (i.e. SBP>140mmHg).\n\nResultsThe data on 4381 individuals were analysed out of which 27.3% were hypertensive. Critical risk factors for hypertension identified were age, obesity, marital status, health state and difficulty with self-care. Strong unobserved household-level residual variations were found.\n\nConclusionHypertension remains high in Ghana. Addressing the problem of obesity, targeting specific interventions to those aged over 50 years, and improvement in the general health of Ghanaians are paramount to reducing the prevalence and its associated morbidity, disability and mortality. Lifestyle modification in the form of dietary intake, knowledge provision supported with strong public health message and political will could be beneficial to the management and prevention of hypertension.","Aheto, J.

"8",90793,"Multi-modality neuroimaging brain-age in UK Biobank: relationship to biomedical, lifestyle and cognitive factors","The brain-age paradigm is proving increasingly useful for exploring ageing-related disease and can predict important future health outcomes. Most brain-age research utilises structural neuroimaging to index brain volume. However, ageing affects multiple aspects of brain structure and function, which can be examined using multi-modality neuroimaging. Using UK Biobank, brain-age was modelled in n=2,205 healthy people with T1-weighted MRI, T2-FLAIR, T2*, diffusion-MRI, task fMRI and resting-state fMRI. In a held-out healthy validation set (n=520), chronological age was accurately predicted (r=0.79, mean absolute error=3.52 years) using LASSO regression, higher than using any modality separately. Thirty-four neuroimaging phenotypes were deemed informative by the regression (after bootstrapping); predominantly grey-matter volume and white-matter microstructure measures. When applied to new individuals from UK Biobank (n=14,701), significant associations with multi-modality brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) were found for: stroke history, diabetes diagnosis, smoking, alcohol intake and some, but not all, cognitive measures (corrected p<0.05). Multi-modality neuroimaging can improve brain-age prediction, and derived brain-PAD values are sensitive to biomedical and lifestyle factors that negatively impact brain and cognitive health.","Cole, J.
