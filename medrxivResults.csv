"1",25,"Disease overarching mechanisms that explain and predict outcome of patients with high cardiovascular risk: rationale and design of the Berlin Long-term Observation of Vascular Events (BeLOVE) study","Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of premature death worldwide. Effective and individualized treatment requires exact knowledge about both risk factors and risk estimation. Most evidence for risk prediction currently comes from population-based studies on first incident cardiovascular events. In contrast, little is known about the relevance of risk factors for the outcome of patients with established CVD or those who are at high risk of CVD, including patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, most studies focus on individual diseases, whereas less is known about disease overarching risk factors and cross-over risk. Aim: The aim of BeLOVE is to improve short- and long-term prediction and mechanistic understanding of cardiovascular disease progression and outcomes in very high-risk patients, both in the acute as well as in the chronic phase, in order to provide the basis for improved, individualized management. Study design: BeLOVE is an observational prospective cohort study of patients of both sexes aged >18 in selected Berlin hospitals, who have a high risk of future cardiovascular events, including patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute stroke (AS), acute heart failure (AHF), acute kidney injury (AKI) or type 2 diabetes with manifest target-organ damage. BeLOVE includes 2 subcohorts: The acute subcohort includes 6500 patients with ACS, AS, AHF, or AKI within 2-8 days after their qualifying event, who undergo a structured interview about medical history as well as blood sample collection. The chronic subcohort includes 6000 patients with ACS, AS, AHF, or AKI 90 days after event, and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and target-organ damage. These patients undergo a 6-8 hour deep phenotyping program, including detailed clinical phenotyping from a cardiological, neurological and metabolic perspective, questionnaires including patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)as well as magnetic resonance imaging. Several biological samples are collected (i.e. blood, urine, saliva, stool) with blood samples collected in a fasting state, as well as after a metabolic challenge (either nutritional or cardiopulmonary exercise stress test). Ascertainment of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) will be performed in all patients using a combination of active and passive follow up procedures, such as on-site visits (if applicable), telephone interviews, review of medical charts, and links to local health authorities. Additional phenotyping visits are planned at 2, 5 and 10 years after inclusion into the chronic subcohort. Future perspective: BeLOVE provides a unique opportunity to study both the short- and long-term disease course of patients at high cardiovascular risk through innovative and extensive deep phenotyping. Moreover, the unique study design provides opportunities for acute and post-acute inclusion and allows us to derive two non-nested yet overlapping sub-cohorts, tailored for upcoming research questions. Thereby, we aim to study disease overarching research questions, to understand crossover risk, and to find similarities and differences between clinical phenotypes of patients at high cardiovascular risk.","Siegerink, B.; Weber, J.; Ahmadi, M.; Eckardt, K.-U.; Edelmann, F.; Endres, M.; Gerhardt, H.; Haubold, K.; Hübner, N.; Landmesser, U.; Leistner, D.; Mai, K.; Müller, D.

"2",401,"Intrinsic capacity as a framework for Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE); insights from the 10/66 Dementia Research Group cohort studies in Latin America, India and China","Background The World Health Organization has reframed health and healthcare for older people around achieving the goal of healthy ageing. Recent evidence-based guidelines on Integrated Care for Older People focus on maintaining intrinsic capacity, addressing declines in mobility, nutrition, vision and hearing, cognition, mood and continence aiming to prevent or delay the onset of care dependence. The target group (with one or more declines in intrinsic capacity) is broad, and implementation at scale may be challenging in less-resourced settings. Planning can be informed by assessing the prevalence of intrinsic capacity, characterising the target group, and validating the general approach by evaluating risk prediction for incident dependence and mortality. Methods Population-based cohort studies in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico, India and China. Sociodemographic, behaviour and lifestyle, health, healthcare utilisation and cost questionnaires, and physical assessments were administered to all participants, with ascertainment of incident dependence, and mortality, three to five years later. Results In the 12 sites in eight countries, 17,031 participants were surveyed at baseline. Intrinsic capacity was least likely to be retained for locomotion (71.2%), vision (71.3%), cognition (73.5%), and mood (74.1%). Only 30% retained full capacity across all domains, varying between one quarter and two-fifths in most sites. The proportion retaining capacity fell sharply with increasing age, and declines affecting multiple domains were more common. Poverty, morbidity (particularly dementia, depression and stroke), and disability were concentrated among those with DIC, although only 10% were frail, and a further 9% had needs for care. Hypertension and lifestyle risk factors for chronic disease, healthcare utilization and costs were more evenly distributed in the general older population. 15,901 participants were included in the mortality cohort (2,602 deaths/ 53,911 person years of follow-up), and 12,965 participants in the dependence cohort (1900 incident cases/ 38,377 person-years). DIC (any decline, and number of domains affected) strongly and independently predicted incident dependence and death. Relative risks were higher for those who were frail, but were also substantially elevated for the much larger sub-groups yet to become frail. Mortality was mainly concentrated in the frail and dependent sub-groups. Conclusions Our findings support the strategy to focus on optimizing intrinsic capacity in pursuit of healthy ageing. Most needs for care arise in those with declines in intrinsic capacity who are yet to become frail. Implementation at scale requires community-based screening and assessment, and a stepped-care approach to intervention. Community healthcare workers roles would need redefinition to engage, train and support them in these tasks. ICOPE could be usefully integrated into community programmes orientated to the detection and case management of chronic diseases including hypertension and diabetes.","Prince, M.

"3",1107,"Dose-response relationship between physical activity and mortality in adults with noncommunicable diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies","Objective To investigate the relationship between post-diagnosis physical activity and mortality in patients with selected noncommunicable diseases, including breast cancer, lung cancer, type 2 diabetes (T2D), ischemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, osteoarthritis, low back pain and major depressive disorders. Design Systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis. Data sources PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science were searched systematically for English publications from the inception of the platforms until August 2018. Additionally, the search was updated in August 2019. Eligibility criteria Prospective observational studies examining the relationship between at least three physical activity categories and all-cause mortality or disease-specific mortality as the primary outcome. Results In total, 28 studies were included: 12 for breast cancer, 6 for T2D, 8 for IHD and 2 for COPD. The linear meta-analysis revealed that each 10 metabolic equivalent tasks (MET) h increase of physical activity per week was associated with a 22% lower mortality rate in breast cancer patients (Hazard Ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.86), 12% in IHD patients (HR, 0.88; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.93), 30% in COPD patients (HR, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.45, 1.09) and 4% in T2D patients (HR, 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). The non-linear meta-analysis showed a regressive association with no threshold for the beneficial effect of physical activity on mortality. Conclusion Higher levels of post-diagnosis physical activity are associated with lower mortality rates in breast cancer, T2D, IHD and COPD patients, with evidence of a no-threshold and non-linear dose-response pattern.","Geidl, W.; Schlesinger, S.; Mino, E.; Miranda, L.; Pfeifer, K.",20191218,"Public And Global Health","10.1101/2019.12.18.19014340","1","Wolfgang Geidl","Department of Sport Science and Sport, Division Exercise and Health, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuernberg, Erlangen, Germany","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19014340v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19014340v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","NA"
"4",1176,"Diabetes mellitus, glycemic traits, and cerebrovascular disease: a Mendelian randomization study","Rationale: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is an established risk factor for cerebrovascular disease but the mechanisms underlying this association remain elusive. Disentangling the causal effects of T2D, hyperglycemia, and pre-diabetic phenotypes (insulin resistance, {beta}-cell dysfunction) on major etiological stroke subtypes (ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke subtypes) could inform the development of preventive strategies. Objective: We employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the effects of genetic predisposition to T2D, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and {beta}-cell dysfunction on risk of stroke subtypes and related cerebrovascular phenotypes. Methods and Results: We selected instruments for genetic predisposition to T2D, HbA1c levels, fasting glucose levels, insulin resistance, and {beta}-cell dysfunction (proxied by pro-insulin levels) based on published genome-wide association studies (up to 898,130 individuals). Applying two-sample MR, we examined associations with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke subtypes (large artery, cardioembolic, small vessel stroke; up to 60,341 cases and 454,450 controls). We further explored associations with the related phenotypes of carotid atherosclerosis, imaging markers of cerebral white matter integrity, and brain atrophy. Genetic predisposition to T2D and elevated HbA1c levels in the pre-diabetic range were associated with higher risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, carotid plaque and small vessel stroke. Independently of HbA1c levels, we further found genetic predisposition to insulin resistance to be associated with large artery and small vessel stroke, whereas predisposition to {beta}-cell dysfunction was associated with small vessel stroke. Predisposition to {beta}-cell dysfunction was further associated with intracerebral hemorrhage, lower grey matter volume, and total brain volume. Conclusions: This study supports causal effects of T2D and hyperglycemia on large artery and small vessel stroke. We show differential effects of genetically determined insulin resistance and {beta}-cell dysfunction on large artery and small vessel stroke that might have implications for anti-diabetic treatments targeting these mechanisms.","Georgakis, M.

"5",2384,"Patient level micro simulation model for evaluating the future potential cost effectiveness of pharmacy based interventions in the control and management of diabetes related complications in Canada","Background: The increased risk of complications among diabetes patients poses a serious threat to population health. Pharmacy-based interventions can decrease the burden of diabetes and its related complications. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of pharmacy-based interventions and offers insights on the practicality of their adoption by health practitioners. Methods: We developed population-based micro-simulation model using 2,931 patients with diabetes in Canada .We used the risk equations on the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) to estimate the incidence and mortality of four of the most common diabetes-related complications (heart failure, stroke, amputation, and blindness). We extrapolated the potential effects of pharmacy interventions on reducing time-varying risk factors for diabetes complications. Cost was quantified as the annual cost of complications; and, the cost associated with pharmacy-based interventions. The final outcomes were the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the robustness of the ratio. Result: Pharmacy-based interventions could prevent 155 preventable deaths, 159 strokes, 29 cases of blindness, 24 amputations, and 19 heart failures across the lifetime of 2,931 patients. In addition, an estimated 953 QALYs (0.32 per patient) would be gained among the intervention group. Per QALY, the incremental discounted cost is $3,928, suggesting that pharmacy-based interventions are likely cost-effective compared to usual care. At an ICER threshold of $50,000, over 92% of the simulation remains cost-effective. Conclusion: Pharmacist-based interventions targeted at addressing the development of diabetes-related complications among Canadian patients have the potential to offer a cost-effective strategy.","Yaghoubi, M.; Mansell, K.; Hassanali Vatanparast, H.; Zeng, W.; Javanbakht, M.; Farag, M.",20200313,"Health Economics","10.1101/2020.03.10.20033597","1","Mohsen Yaghoubi","The University of British Columbia","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033597v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033597v1.full.pdf","cc0_ng","NA"
"6",3311,"Phenotypic Associations and Shared Genetic Etiology between Bipolar Disorder and Cardiometabolic Traits","Background: People with bipolar disorder (BPD) are more likely to die prematurely, which is partly attributed to comorbid cardiometabolic traits. BPD has a bidirectional relationship with cardiometabolic traits, but their shared etiology is poorly understood. This study aimed to examine the phenotypic associations and shared genetic etiology between BPD and various cardiometabolic traits. Methods: In a subset of the UK Biobank sample (N = 67,317) we investigated phenotypic associations between BPD (n = 4,155) and cardiometabolic traits, represented by biomarkers, anthropometric traits and cardiometabolic diseases. To determine the shared genetic etiology, polygenic risk scores and genetic correlations were calculated between BPD and these traits. Results: Several cardiometabolic traits were significantly associated with increased risk for BPD, namely low total cholesterol, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high triglycerides, high glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), low systolic blood pressure, high body mass index, high waist-to-hip ratio, as well as stroke, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Polygenic risk score regressions showed that higher polygenic risk for triglycerides, waist-to-hip ratio, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes was associated with increased risk for bipolar disorder. These associations were not replicated when using genetic correlations. Conclusions: This large study identified phenotypic cardiometabolic risk factors for BPD. Moreover, it found that comorbidities between BPD and waist-to-hip ratio, triglycerides, type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease may be based on shared genetic etiology. These results provide a better understanding of the phenotypic and genetic comorbidity between BPD and cardiometabolic traits.","Fürtjes, A. E.; Coleman, J. R.; Tyrrell, J.; Lewis, C.

"7",3520,"Barriers to healthcare for autistic adults: Consequences & policy implications. A cross-sectional study.","Background: Autism is associated with reduced life expectancy, poor physical and mental health, and increased prevalence of epilepsy, obesity, hypertension, diabetes and stroke. Aim: To quantify self-reported barriers to healthcare and their consequences amongst autistic adults and compare with parents of autistic children and non-autistic controls Design and Setting: An online survey was developed from a qualitative study undertaken at Autscape, an autistic conference. Method: Thematic analysis of 75 responses was used to develop a 57-item online survey completed by 1,271 autistic adults, 406 parents of autistic children and 303 control subjects. Results: Difficulty visiting a GP was reported by 78.2% of autistic adults, 51.4% of parents and 34.9% of controls. The highest-rated barriers by autistic adults were deciding if symptoms warrant a GP visit (71.9%), difficulty using the telephone to book appointments (60.7%), not feeling understood (55.5%) and difficulty communicating with their doctor (53.0%). A higher rate of adverse health outcomes was reported by autistic adults; untreated physical and mental health conditions, not attending specialist referral or screening programmes, requiring more extensive treatment or surgery due to late presentations, and untreated potentially life threatening conditions. Autistic adults reported a need for online or text based appointment booking, facility to email in advance the reason for consultation, first or last clinic appointment and a quiet place to wait. Conclusion: Reduction of healthcare inequalities for autistic people requires that healthcare providers understand autistic culture and communication needs. Adjustments for autistic communication needs are as necessary as ramps are for wheelchair users.","Doherty, M.; O'sullivan, J. D.; Neilson, S.

"8",4982,"Inclusion of medical fitness to drive in medical postgraduate training curricula","Background: Transport mobility, and access to driving, is an important factor in social inclusion and well-being. Doctors have an important role to play in supporting safe mobility through applying the knowledge developed in the field of traffic medicine and incorporating state of the art national and international medical fitness to drive (MFTD) guidelines. Little is known about the profile of MFTD in postgraduate curricula for core and higher specialist training. Aims: We profiled the inclusion of MFTD in the curricula of postgraduate core, higher and streamlined medical and surgical specialties in the Republic of Ireland and the UK. Methods: All publicly available syllabi of basic and higher/ streamlined specialist training in postgraduate medical and surgical colleges in both jurisdictions were analysed (N = 122). Results: In Ireland, 25% of basic training schemes included MFTD in the curriculum. Two-thirds of curricula of higher specialty and streamlined training schemes also included MFTD. For the UK, 44% of core and 36% of higher training schemes curricula included MFTD. Just under one-quarter of all curricula reviewed included MFTD for more than one medical condition or treatment. Common topics in both Irish and UK curricula included seizures/epilepsy, syncope and visual disturbances. Conclusion: There are notable deficits in MFTD training for specialists in Ireland and the UK. Common conditions which can significantly impair MFTD such as stroke, diabetes and alcohol use disorders are severely underrepresented and curricula should be revisited to include relevant training and guidance for MFTD for trainees.","Al Azawi, L.; O'byrne, A.; Roche, L.; O'neill, D.; Ryan, M.",20200425,"Medical Education","10.1101/2020.04.22.20075465","1","Desmond O'neill","National Office for Traffic Medicine, Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075465v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075465v1.full.pdf","cc_no","NA"
"9",5229,"Cardiovascular safety and efficacy of combination therapy with metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors versus metformin and sulfonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","Background: Diabetes mellitus is a serious threat to global health and among the top 10 causes of death, with nearly half a billion people living with it worldwide. Treating patients with diabetes tend to become more challenging due to the nature of the disease. The role and benefits of combination therapies for the management of type 2 diabetes are well-documented, while the comparative safety and efficacy among the different combination options have not been elucidated. We aimed to systematically synthesize the evidence on the comparative cardiovascular safety and efficacy of combination therapy with metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors versus metformin and sulfonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes. Method: We searched MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 15 August 2019 and without restriction in the year of publication. We included randomized controlled trials of patients with type 2 diabetes who were on metformin- sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors or metformin-sulphonylureas combination therapy at least for a year. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events, and the secondary endpoints were cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hypoglycemia, and changes in glycosylated hemoglobin A1C, body weight, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Random effect model was carried out to calculate mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes between the two combination therapies. Results: Of 3,190 citations, we included nine trials involving 10,974 participants. The pooled analysis showed no significance difference in all-cause mortality (RR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.52, 1.67]), serious adverse events (RR=0.96, 95% CI [0.79, 1.17]) and adverse events (RR=1.00, 95% CI [0.99, 1.02]) between the two, but in hypoglycemia (RR= 0.13, 95% CI [0.10, 0.17], P<0.00001). Participants taking metformin-sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors showed a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c (MD= -0.10, 95% CI [-0.17, -0.03] %, body weight (MD= -4.57, 95% CI [-4.74, -4.39] kg, systolic blood pressure (MD=-4.77, 95% CI [-5.39, -4.16] mmHg, p<0.00001), diastolic blood pressure (MD=-2.07, 95% CI [-2.74, -1.40] mmHg, and fasting plasma glucose (MD= -0.55, 95% CI [-0.69, -0.41] mmol/L, p < 0.00001). Conclusion: A combination therapy of metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors is a safe and efficacious alternative to combination therapy of metformin and sulphonylureas for patients with type 2 diabetes who are at risk of cardiovascular comorbidity. However, there remains a need for additional long-term randomized controlled trials as available studies are very limited and heterogeneous.

"10",6009,"Etiologic Subtypes of Ischemic Stroke in SARS-COV-2 Virus patients","Objective: To describe the ischemic stroke etiopathogenesis related to COVID-19 in a cohort of NYC hospitals. Background: Extra-pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 has been reported in the hepatic, renal and hematological systems. Most neurological manifestations are non-focal but few have reported the characteristics of ischemic strokes or investigated its pathophysiology. Methods: Over the last 6 weeks, data from four centers in New York City were collected to review the possible ischemic stroke types seen in COVID-19 positive patients. Their presentation, demographics, other related vascular risk factors, associated laboratory and coagulation markers, as well as imaging and outcomes were collected. Results: In our study, age range of patients was 25-75 with no significant male preponderance. 70% presented for acute hospitalization due the stroke. About a fifth did not have common risk factors for ischemic stroke like diabetes and hypertension. None had history of atrial fibrillation or smoking. 50% had poor outcome with four ending in mortality and one in a critical condition due ARDS. All had high Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ratio except one who demonstrated some neurological recovery. In 70% of our cases, D-dimer levels were collected, and all showed mild to severe elevation. None of the emergent large vessel occlusion (LVO) cases had known cardiac risk factors but two out of five were found to have cardiac abnormalities during the course of their hospitalization. All LVOs had hypercoagulable lab markers especially elevated D-dimer and/or Fibrinogen. The LVO patients were younger and sicker with a median age of 46 and mean NIHSS of 24 as opposed to non-LVOs with a median age of 62 and mean NIHSS of 6 respectively. Conclusion: COVID-19 related ischemic events can be small vessel, branch emboli or large vessel occlusions. The latter is often associated with either a hypercoagulable state or cardio-embolism. Patient outcomes were worse when multi-organ or pulmonary system failure prevailed.

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to explore the association of pre-existing conditions with COVID-19 mortality. Methods We searched MEDLINE, OVID databases, SCOPUS, and medrxiv.org for the period December 1, 2019, to May 1, 2020. The outcome of interest was the risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients with and without pre-existing conditions. Comorbidities explored were cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, and stroke. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models and heterogeneity was quantified. Results Ten chronic conditions from 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis (n = 61,455 patients with COVID-19; mean age, 61 years; 57% male). Overall the between-study study heterogeneity was medium and studies had low publication bias and high quality. Coronary heart disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cancer significantly increased the risk of mortality from COVID-19. The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with coronary heart disease was 2.4 times as high as those without coronary heart disease (RR= 2.40, 95%CI=1.71-3.37, n=5) and twice as high in patients with hypertension as high as that compared to those without hypertension (RR=1.89, 95%CI= 1.58-2.27, n=9). Patients with cancer also were at twice the risk of mortality from COVID-19 compared to those without cancer (RR=1.93 95%CI 1.15-3.24, n=4), and those with congestive heart failure were at 2.5 times the risk of mortality compared to those without congestive heart failure (RR=2.66, 95%CI 1.58-4.48, n=3). Conclusions COVID-19 patients with all any cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cancer have an increased risk of mortality. Tailored infection prevention and treatment strategies targeting this high-risk population are warranted to optimize survival.","Ssentongo, P.; Ssentongo, A. E.; Heilbrunn, E. S.; Ba, D.

"12",6636,"Pre-existing Cardiovascular Disease in United States Population at High Risk for Severe COVID-19 Infection","Background and Purpose There is increasing recognition of a relatively high burden of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) infected patients. We determined the burden of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in persons residing in United States (US) who are at risk for severe COVID-19 infection. Methods Age (60 years or greater), presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, mellitus, hypertension, and/or malignancy were used to identify persons at risk for admission to intensive care unit, or invasive ventilation, or death with COVID-19 infection. Persons were classified as low risk (no risk factors), moderate risk (1 risk factor), and high risk (two or more risk factors present) using nationally representative sample of US adults from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017 and 2018 survey. Results Among a total of 5856 participants, 2386 (40.7%) were considered low risk, 1325 (22.6%) moderate risk, and 2145 persons (36.6%) as high risk for severe COVID-19 infection. The proportion of patients who had pre-existing stroke increased from 0.6% to 10.5% in low risk patients to high risk patients (odds ratio [OR]19.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]11.6-34.3). The proportion of who had pre-existing myocardial infection (MI) increased from 0.4% to 10.4% in low risk patients to high risk patients (OR 30.6, 95% CI 15.7-59.8). Conclusions A large proportion of persons in US who are at risk for developing severe COVID 19 infection are expected to have pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Further studies need to identify whether targeted strategies towards cardiovascular diseases can reduce the mortality in COVID-19 infected patients.","Qureshi, A.

"13",6912,"Behavioural change towards reduced intensity physical activity is disproportionately prevalent among adults with serious health issues or self-perception of high risk during the UK COVID-19 lockdown.","Importance: There are growing concerns that the UK COVID-19 lockdown has reduced opportunities to maintain health through physical activity, placing individuals at higher risk of chronic disease and leaving them more vulnerable to severe sequelae of COVID-19. Objective: To examine whether the UK's lockdown measures have had disproportionate impacts on intensity of physical activity in groups who are, or who perceive themselves to be, at heightened risk from COVID-19. Designs, Setting, Participants: UK-wide survey of adults aged over 20, data collected between 2020-04-06 and 2020-04-22. Exposures: Self-reported doctor-diagnosed obesity, hypertension, type I/II diabetes, lung disease, cancer, stroke, heart disease. Self-reported disabilities and depression. Sex, gender, educational qualifications, household income, caring for school-age children. Narrative data on coping strategies. Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in physical activity intensity after implementation of UK COVID-19 lockdown (self-reported). Results: Most (60%) participants achieved the same level of intensity of physical activity during the lockdown as before the epidemic. Doing less intensive physical activity during the lockdown was associated with obesity (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.41), hypertension (OR 1.52, 1.33-1.71), lung disease (OR 1.31,1.13-1.49), depression (OR 2.02, 1.82-2.22) and disability (OR 2.34, 1.99-2.69). Participants who reduced their physical activity intensity also had higher odds of being female, living alone or having no garden, and more commonly expressed sentiments about personal or household risks in narratives on coping. Conclusions and relevance: Groups who reduced physical activity intensity included disproportionate numbers of people with either heightened objective clinical risks or greater tendency to express subjective perceptions of risk. Policy on exercise for health during lockdowns should include strategies to facilitate health promoting levels of physical activity in vulnerable groups, including those with both objective and subjective risks.","Rogers, N.

"14",7272,"Ischemic Heart Disease and Cognitive Prognosis in the First Year after Stroke","Importance: Cognitive impairment is the greatest single source of unmet need identified by stroke survivors. Knowledge of the factors that influence cognitive prognosis will lead to better preventive and rehabilitation strategies. Objective: To identify the factors that influence general cognitive function, memory and executive function in the first year after ischemic stroke. Design: Single centre longitudinal observational study. Setting: Hospital stroke service. Participants: A cohort of 179 patients identified within 7 days of first symptomatic ischaemic stroke were enrolled into a longitudinal cognitive study, STRATEGIC. General cognitive function, episodic memory and executive function were assessed in the first three months and again at one year after stroke. Lesion topography was defined by imaging (n=152) performed in the acute period. Cognitive evaluation was repeated at one year in 141 participants. Main Outcome Measures: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score at 1 year. Verbal free recall (Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test) and Digit Symbol Substitution Score provided secondary outcome measures of episodic memory and executive function respectively. Results: At 50+-19 days after stroke, diabetes mellitus and smoking were associated with MoCA score independent of other risk and demographic factors. Lesion vascular territory was independently associated with memory while white matter lesion burden was associated with executive function. In contrast to other risk factors, ischaemic heart disease was associated with change in cognitive scores and MoCA score at one year but not MoCA score at 3 months. IHD was the only factor significantly associated with change over time. This association was significant independent of other factors. Conclusions and Relevance: Associations between post-stroke cognition, and age, diabetes, smoking and white matter lesions, are likely to reflect the general effects of these factors on brain structure and function. These risk factors are not associated with change in cognitive function between 3 months and one year. In contrast, pre-existing ischemic heart disease was associated specifically with change in cognition over time. On average, patients with IHD showed decline in MoCA scores between 3 and 12 months while those free of IHD showed improvement. Intervention for IHD, alongside best-care stroke rehabilitation, merits investigation as a strategy to improve cognitive prognosis after stroke.","O'sullivan, M.

"15",8270,"The impact of lung function on cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular risk factors: a two sample bi-directional Mendelian randomization study","Background: Observational studies suggested lung function is inversely associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) although these studies could be susceptible to residual confounding. We conducted a 2 sample Mendelian randomization study using summary statistics from genome wide association studies (GWAS) to clarify the role of lung function in CVD and its risk factors, and conversely the role of CVD in lung function. Methods: We obtained genetic instruments for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) from publicly available UK Biobank summary statistics (n=421,986). We applied these genetic instruments for FEV1 (260) and FVC (320) to publicly available GWAS summary statistics for coronary artery disease (CAD) (n=184,305), stroke and its subtypes (n=446,696), atrial fibrillation (n=1,030,836), and heart failure (n=977,320) and cardiovascular risk factors. Inverse variance weighting was used to assess the impact of lung function on these outcomes. Sensitivity analyses included MR-Egger, weighted median, MR-PRESSO, and multivariable Mendelian randomization. We also conducted bi-directional Mendelian randomization to assess whether CVD affects lung function. Results: FEV1 and FVC were inversely associated with CAD (odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation (SD) increase, 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.82) and 0.70 (95%CI 0.62 to 0.78)), overall stroke (0.87 (95%CI 0.77 to 0.97), 0.90 (0.82 to 1.00)), ischemic stroke (0.87 (95%CI 0.77 to 0.99), 0.90 (95%CI 0.80 to 1.00)), small vessel stroke (0.78, (95%CI 0.61 to 1.00), 0.74 (95%CI 0.61 to 0.92)), and large artery stroke (0.69 (95%CI 0.54 to 0.89), 0.72 (95%CI 0.57 to 0.91)). FEV1 and FVC were inversely associated with type 2 diabetes (0.75 (95%CI 0.62 to 0.90), 0.67 (95%CI 0.58 to 0.79)) and systolic blood pressure. Sensitivity analyses produced similar direction for most outcomes although the magnitude sometimes differed. Adjusting for height attenuated results for CAD (e.g. OR for 1SD FEV1 0.95 (0.76 to 1.20), but this may reflect weak instrument bias. This adjustment did not attenuate effects for stroke or type 2 diabetes. No strong evidence was observed for CVD affecting lung function. Conclusion: Higher lung function likely protect against CAD and stroke.","Au Yeung, S. L.; Borges, M. C.; Lawlor, D.

"16",8499,"Protocol for partnering with peers intervention to improve medication adherence among African Americans with Type 2 Diabetes","African Americans (AAs) with diabetes are more likely to develop diabetes-related complications and have the highest diabetes-related mortality rates, than all other racial/ethnic groups. These health disparities are primarily due to poor medication adherence (defined as not taking medications as prescribed). AAs have substantially lower adherence to diabetes medications than whites, which contributes to higher rates of diabetes-related complications, such as amputations and strokes. There is a critical need to develop diabetes self-management interventions that improve medication adherence, clinical outcomes and in turn reduce morbidity and mortality among AAs with diabetes. Focusing on psychosocial factors such as health beliefs, self-efficacy and patient-provider communication is instrumental to improving AAs medication adherence. To address this need, we developed, the Peers Supporting Health Literacy, Self-Efficacy, Self-Advocacy, and Adherence (Peers LEAD) intervention, which provides AAs with culturally adapted diabetes and medication beliefs information, one-on-one peer support from AAs with diabetes, and communication and self-efficacy skill development to enhance medication adherence. This pilot research is a pre-post single group intervention study design which will be conducted in two phases using a community engaged approach. The objective is to test the Peers LEAD intervention in Phase 1, and then examine specific intervention elements for refinement in Phase 2. We will employ both quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes of Peers LEAD. Building on established community partnerships, we plan to recruit and enroll 30 Peer Buddies and 20 Peer Ambassadors to participate in the intervention. By utilizing patient feedback to refine Peers LEAD and piloting it to examine its feasibility, we will generate evidence regarding its real world use and provide support for a randomized controlled trial of its impact on AAs diabetes medication adherence and clinical outcomes.","Shiyanbola, O.

"17",9282,"Association of hypertension, diabetes, stroke, cancer, kidney disease, and high-cholesterol with COVID-19 disease severity and fatality: a systematic review","Objective: To undertake a review and critical appraisal of published/preprint reports that offer methods of determining the effects of hypertension, diabetes, stroke, cancer, kidney issues, and high-cholesterol on COVID-19 disease severity. Data sources: Google Scholar, PubMed, COVID-19 Open Research Dataset: a resource of over 128,000 scholarly articles, including over 59,000 articles with full text related to COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and coronaviruses. Methods: A search was conducted by two authors independently on the freely available COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We developed an automated search engine to screen a total of 59,000 articles in a few seconds. The search engine was built using a retrieval function that ranks a set of documents based on the query terms appearing in each document regardless of their proximity within the document. Filtering of the articles was then undertaken using keywords and questions, e.g. ""Effects of diabetes on COVID/normal coronavirus/SARS-CoV-2/nCoV/COVID-19 disease severity, mortality?"". The search terms were repeated for all the comorbidities considered in this paper. Additional articles were retrieved by searching via Google Scholar and PubMed. Findings: A total of 54 articles were considered for a full review. It was observed that diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol levels possess an apparent relation to COVID-19 severity. Other comorbidities, such as cancer, kidney disease, and stroke, must be further evaluated to determine a strong relationship to the virus. Reports associating cancer, kidney disease, and stroke with COVID-19 should be carefully interpreted, not only because of the size of the samples, but also because patients could be old, have a history of smoking, or have any other clinical condition suggesting that these factors might be associated with the poor COVID-19 outcomes rather than the comorbidity itself. Such reports could lead many oncologists and physicians to change their treatment strategies without solid evidence and recommendations. Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted. Additionally, treatment options must be examined further to provide optimal treatment and ensure better outcomes for patients suffering from these comorbidities. It should be noted that, whether definitive measurements exist or not, the care of patients as well as the research involved should be largely prioritized to tackle this deadly pandemic.","Zaki, N.; Alashwal, H.; Ibrahim, S.",20200619,"Epidemiology","10.1101/2020.06.16.20132639","1","Nazar Zaki","United Arab Emirates University (UAEU)","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.20132639v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.20132639v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc",NA
